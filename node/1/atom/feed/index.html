    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The "Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment" is an extremely fast-performing and energy-saving desktop environment. Maintained by an international community of developers, it comes with a beautiful interface, multi-language support, standard keyboard short cuts and additional features like tabbed file browsing. LXDE uses less CPU and less RAM than other environments. It is especially designed for cloud computers with low hardware specifications, such as netbooks, mobile devices (e.g. MIDs) or older computers. LXDE can be installed on many Linux distributions including Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE and Ubuntu. It is the standard for Knoppix and lubuntu. LXDE also runs on OpenSolaris and BSD. LXDE provides a fast desktop experience; connecting easily with applications in the cloud. LXDE supports a wealth of programs that can be installed locally with Linux systems. The source code of LXDE is licensed partly under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt">GNU General Public License</a> and partly under the LGPL.

<p>
LXDE is a GPL licensed open source desktop environment for Unix and other POSIX compliant platforms, such as Linux. The name LXDE stands for &quot;Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment&quot;. </p>
<p>
LXDE is an energy saving and extremely fast and performing desktop solution. It works well with computers on the low end of the performance spectrum such as new generation netbooks and other small mobile computers. LXDE is designed for cloud networks such as local freifunk clouds or the global Internet cloud.  It can be built on top of various Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora. It is the standard for Knoppix and lubuntu. LXDE also runs with OpenSolaris and BSD. It provides a fast desktop experience connecting easily with applications in the cloud and supports a wealth of programs, that can be installed with Linux systems locally. LXDE already supports many computer processor architectures including Intel, MIPS and ARM. 
</p>
<p>
The LXDE project started 2006 when Hong Yen Jee from Taiwan, known as PCMan, published the first component PCMan File Manager. Today the LXDE team has grown into an international community of developers, designers and contributors from all over the world.

<h3>Recommended configuration</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The hardware requirements of LXDE are similiar to Windows 98 (Maybe a little bit higher). An old Pentium II CPU is enough.</li>
	<li>After X11 and LXDE are started, the total memory usage is about 45 MB on i386 machines. (This value may be higher or lower according to different system configurations.)</li>
	<li>Though LXDE itself doesn&#39;t require better hardware, other applications under X do need it. For example, Firefox and OpenOffice.org 2 are quite memory-hungry. So it&#39;s recommended that you have a RAM of more than 128 MB.</li>
</ul>
